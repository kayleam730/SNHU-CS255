# SNHU-CS255

The DriverPass project was for a client who wanted to design a system to help students prepare for driving tests. The system needed to fill a gap in the market by automating the scheduling process, tracking users’ progress, and offering online classes to support students in learning to drive. My task was to create UML diagrams (use case, activity, sequence, and class diagrams) that represented the system’s functionality, structure, and behavior, and to describe the technical requirements.

I did particularly well in articulating the purpose of the system and clearly defining the objectives and goals, like automating scheduling and offering online classes.

If I could revise one part of my work, I would improve the UML diagrams, particularly the activity diagrams. I would add more detailed workflows to ensure they fully capture all necessary system interactions. This would help clarify how each user interacts with different parts of the system.

When interpreting the user’s needs, I focused on providing a user-friendly solution for students and instructors, which included the ability to track progress and easily schedule lessons. It is crucial to consider user needs because the system’s success depends on how effectively it solves the users’ problems and meets their expectations.

In future system design projects, I would approach software design by emphasizing requirement gathering and validation. Techniques like creating wireframes, refining UML diagrams, and consulting with end-users will help in analyzing and designing systems that closely align with user needs and functional requirements.
